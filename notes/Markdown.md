[I'm an inline-style link](https://github.com/)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
https://github.com/ or <https://github.com/> and sometimes
example.com (but not on GitHub, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/
[1]: https://slashdot.org/
[link text itself]: https://github.com/
```

## Tables

```md
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (`|`) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

## Code and syntax highlighting

Inline codes are fenced by single back ticks (\`). Code blocks are fenced by triple back ticks.

For code blocks, syntax highlighting is possible. Name the language right after the first three back ticks.

[List of languages supported by GitHub flavoured markdown](https://www.rubycoloredglasses.com/2013/04/languages-supported-by-github-flavored-markdown/):

> Github uses Linguist to perform language detection and syntax highlighting [...] [(see full list in Linguist - languages.yml)](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).

## Horizontal rule

Three or more hyphens `---`, asterisks `***` or underscores `___`

## [Text alignment](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14051715)

```md
<p align="center">centered text</p>
```

<p align="center">centered text</p>

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
